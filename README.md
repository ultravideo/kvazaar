## Using Kvazaar

### Example:

    kvazaar --input BQMall_832x480_60.yuv --output out.hevc

The mandatory parameters are input and output. If the resolution of the input file is not in the filename, or when pipe is used, the input resolution must also be given: ```--input-res=1920x1080```.

The default input format is 8-bit yuv420p for 8-bit and yuv420p10le for 10-bit. Input format and bitdepth can be selected with ```--input-format``` and ```--input-bitdepth```.

Speed and compression quality can be selected with ```--preset```, or by setting the options manually.

### LP-GOP syntax
The LP-GOP syntax is "lp-g(num)d(num)t(num)", where
- g = GOP length.
- d = Number of GOP layers.
- t = How many references to skip for temporal scaling, where 4 means only
  every fourth picture needs to be decoded.

```

## Presets
The names of the presets are the same as with x264: ultrafast,
superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower, veryslow and
placebo. The effects of the presets are listed in the following table,
where the names have been abbreviated to fit the layout in GitHub.

## Kvazaar library
See [kvazaar.h](src/kvazaar.h) for the library API and its
documentation.

When using the static Kvazaar library on Windows, macro `KVZ_STATIC_LIB`
must be defined. On other platforms it's not strictly required.

The needed linker and compiler flags can be obtained with pkg-config.


## Compiling Kvazaar
If you have trouble regarding compiling the source code, please make an
[issue](https://github.com/ultravideo/kvazaar/issues) about in Github.
Others might encounter the same problem and there is probably much to
improve in the build process. We want to make this as simple as
possible.


### Required libraries
- For Visual Studio, the pthreads-w32 library is required. Platforms
  with native POSIX thread support don't need anything.
  - The project file expects the library to be in ../pthreads.2/
    relative to Kvazaar. You can just extract the pre-built library
    there.
  - The executable needs pthreadVC2.dll to be present. Either install it
    somewhere or ship it with the executable.


### Autotools
Depending on the platform, some additional tools are required for compiling Kvazaar with autotools.
For Ubuntu, the required packages are `automake autoconf libtool m4 build-essential yasm`. Yasm is
optional, but some of the optimization will not be compiled in if it's missing.

Run the following commands to compile and install Kvazaar.

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

See `./configure --help` for more options.


### OS X
- Install Homebrew
- run ```brew install automake libtool yasm```
- Refer to Autotools instructions


### Visual Studio
- At least VisualStudio 2013 is required.
- Project files can be found under build/.
- Requires external [vsyasm.exe](http://yasm.tortall.net/Download.html)
  in %PATH%


### Docker
This project includes a [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile), which enables building for Docker. Kvazaar is also available in the Docker Hub [`ultravideo/kvazaar`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ultravideo/kvazaar/)
Build using Docker: `docker build -t kvazaar .`
Example usage: `docker run -i -a STDIN -a STDOUT kvazaar -i - --input-res=320x240 -o - < testfile_320x240.yuv > out.265`
For other examples, see [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile)


### Visualization (Windows only)
Compiling `kvazaar_cli` project in the `visualizer` branch results in a Kvazaar executable with visualization enabled.

Additional Requirements: [`SDL2`](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), [`SDL2-ttf`](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/).

Directory `visualizer_extras` has to be added into the same directory level as the kvazaar project directory. Inside should be directories `include` and `lib` found from the development library zip packages.

`SDL2.dll`, `SDL2_ttf.dll`, `libfreetype-6.dll`, `zlib1.dll`, and `pthreadVC2.dll` should be placed in the working directory (i.e. the folder the `kvazaar.exe` is in after compiling the `kvazaar_cli` project/solution) when running the visualizer. The required `.dll` can be found in the aforementioned `lib`-folder (`lib\x64`) and the dll folder inside the pthreads folder (see `Required libraries`).

Note: The solution should be compiled on the x64 platform in visual studio.

Optional font file `arial.ttf` is to be placed in the working directory, if block info tool is used.


## Contributing to Kvazaar
We are happy to look at pull requests in Github. There is still lots of work to be done.


### Code documentation
You can generate Doxygen documentation pages by running the command
"doxygen docs.doxy". Here is a rough sketch of the module structure:
![Kvazaar module hierarchy](https://github.com/ultravideo/kvazaar/blob/master/doc/kvazaar_module_hierarchy.png)


### For version control we try to follow these conventions:
- Master branch always produces a working bitstream (can be decoded with
  HM).
- Commits for new features and major changes/fixes put to a sensibly
  named feature branch first and later merged to the master branch.
- Always merge the feature branch to the master branch, not the other
  way around, with fast-forwarding disabled if necessary.
- Every commit should at least compile.


### Testing
- Main automatic way of testing is with Travis CI. Commits, branches
  and pull requests are tested automatically.
  - Uninitialized variables and such are checked with Valgrind.
  - Bitstream validity is checked with HM.
  - Compilation is checked on GCC and Clang on Linux, and Clang on OSX.
- Windows msys2 build is checked automatically on Appveyor.
- If your changes change the bitstream, decode with HM to check that
  it doesn't throw checksum errors or asserts.
- If your changes shouldn't alter the bitstream, check that they don't.
- Automatic compression quality testing is in the works.


### Unit tests
- There are some unit tests located in the tests directory. We would
  like to have more.
- The Visual Studio project links the unit tests against the actual .lib
  file used by the encoder. There is no Makefile as of yet.
- The unit tests use "greatest" unit testing framework. It is included
  as a submodule, but getting it requires the following commands to be
  run in the root directory of kvazaar:

        git submodule init
        git submodule update

- On Linux, run ```make test```.


### Code style
We try to follow the following conventions:
- C99 without features not supported by Visual Studio 2013 (VLAs).
 - // comments allowed and encouraged.
- Follow overall conventions already established in the code.
- Indent by 2 spaces. (no tabs)
- { on the same line for control logic and on the next line for functions
- Reference and deference next to the variable name.
- Variable names in lowered characters with words divided by underscore.
- Maximum line length 79 characters when possible.
- Functions only used inside the module shouldn't be defined in the
  module header. They can be defined in the beginning of the .c file if
  necessary.
- Symbols defined in headers prefixed with kvz_ or KVZ_.
- Includes in alphabetic order.
